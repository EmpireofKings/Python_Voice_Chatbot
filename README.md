# python_app

Start main.py to use the full functional chatbot in your Telegram app. 

## Confidential.py
You will need the CONFIDENTIAL.py file to use this bot. For that I provided a CONFIDENTIAL_Template.py-File
which contains example parameters. Please change all params and then rename the file to "CONFIDENTIAL.py". 

After that you will be able to use the bot in Telegram with all it's features.
